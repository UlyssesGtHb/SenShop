              <p>The <strong>VCT x SEN Capsule</strong> is a collection of cosmetics in VALORANT as part of VCT Team Capsules showcasing the VCT Americas Team Sentinels. Its contents were available in the Esports Store whenever the VCT season is available. Items within the set could not be purchased individually; players had to buy each of the complete capsule sets to unlock any of its contents. A portion of net proceeds from each capsule were shared to the respective VCT partner teams in each season. </p>

      <h2 class="highlight">Customer Reviews</h2>
      <p>"While its high-tech aesthetic and unique reload sound are appealing, the bundle's price may not justify the cost for players who rarely use the Classic. It’s a great pick for Sentinels fans or those looking to add some flair to their loadout." – <strong>Alex M.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="bangzerra-kaplan">
      <p>"The Sentinels Classic Bundle offers a sleek, futuristic design with metallic textures and satisfying animations, making the Classic pistol feel premium." – <strong>Yinsu C.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="bangzerra-kaplan">
      <p>"The clean and minimalistic design features a mix of black, silver, and red accents, providing a refined look without being overly flashy. While it’s a solid cosmetic choice for fans of sleek weapon skins, its value is more evident for those who frequently use the Classic pistol in-game.. Highly recommend!" – <strong>Josh W.</strong></p>

  <div class="bangzerra-kaplan">
  <p>"This skin is sleek, clean, and gives your Classic that high-tech, premium feel—perfect for anyone who wants to stand out in style. The animations? Smooth as heck, and the sound when you reload just hits different. It’s not just a skin; it’s a statement. Trust me, you’re gonna want this if you want that extra edge, especially if you're rocking the Classic often!" - <strong>ZELLSIS</strong></p>

<!-- FAQs Section -->
<section id="faqs" class="johnqt">
  <h2 class="highlight">FAQs</h2>
  <div class="johnqt-item">
    <h3>What is included in the Bundle/Capsule?</h3>
    <p>As Mentioned in the 'Key Features' tab, it includes the classic skin itself, player card, gun buddy, and a spray.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="johnqt-item">
    <h3>When Can you Snag These?</h3>
    <p>Throughout the 2025 VCT Season, you can purchase Capsules in VALORANT through the brand new in-game Esports Store - just go to the Store page and click on the “Esports” tab. Capsules will go live in most regions alongside the release of the current Patch.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="johnqt-item">
    <h3>Why Team Capsules?</h3>
    <p>It goes beyond being a cool skin that is worthy of being in your collection (although that's still a part of it). It's about creating a vibrant ecosystem where fans and teams thrive together.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="johnqt-item">
    <h3>Does it improve accuracy?</h3>
    <p>Well, yes and no! Yes, in a way that boosts your confidence and show off your support for the organization. And No, because Riot Games will not allow any form of cheating as it breaks the competitive integrity.</p>
